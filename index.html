                <h3>How does JavaScript work?</h3>
                <p>The JavaScript code we write is read and executed by JavaScript engines like V8 or SpiderMonkey. JS
                    engine converts the JS code into machine instructions and then execute as a just-in-time compiler.
                    JS engine consists of a Heap and a Call Stack. For all objects, variables and etc in code, the
                    memory allocation happen in Heap. Call Stack works in 'First in Last out' manner to read and execute
                    code line by line and keep track of the current execution. JS is a single threaded, as it has only a
                    single Call Stack. Anonymous functions are used to execute multiple tasks in parallel is JS and not
                    to block the thread.
                </p>

                <h3>What does JavaScript event loop do?</h3>
                <p>Event loop in JavaScript continuously check for events in the Callback Queue. If Call Stack is empty
                    then event loop take an event from the queue and put it in th Call Stack. While Callback Queue is
                    empty event loop goes to sleep until new task added to the queue. While asynchronous callbacks
                    appear in Call Stack, they are sent to Web API for further processing. After timer or XHR request
                    completes the task is added to the back of the queue. And event loop starts working.
                </p>

                <h3>What are the differences between cookies, local storage and session storage?</h3>
                <p>cookies, localStorage and sessionStorage both are used to store data in browser for use later, but
                    they have different uses. localStorage data will be stored permanently in browser unless they are
                    explicitly removed. Whereas, sessionStorage data will be stored in browser as long as the tab is
                    open. And cookies will be stored in browser or server until they expires. cookies expiration time
                    set manually. cookies are sent to the server on every request, while sessionStorage and localStorage
                    cannot. sessionStorage only works in a single tab, but cookies and localStorage can be accessible
                    through out the browser. The data, which will be sent to the server or has a expiration time are
                    stored in cookies. sessionStorage And localStorage are used for any other types of data. But
                    sessionStorage is better, because it will be cleared on closing the tab.
